I am currently an engineer, researcher and manager at Google.
Previously, I was a tenured professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt
University. My work and interests focus on

-   GenAI task-specific customization (tuning, distillation, evaluation)
    and LLM agents
-   Reinforcement learning and stochastic optimization for planning and
    decision-making under uncertainty
-   LLM reasoning and planning
