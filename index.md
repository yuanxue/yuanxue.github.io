I am a researcher and builder focused on turning AI into real-world impact. I value curiosity, clarity, and disciplined execution. I believe landing the value of AI requires both scientific depth and hands-on craftsmanship. I enjoy open dialogue, sharing what I’ve learned, and learning from others along the way.

I currently serve as the Head of Enterprise AI at Scale AI. Previously I worked at Google Cloud AI and Google Brain as a senior manager, engineering leader and senior staff SWE. Earlier in my career, I was a tenured Computer Science professor at Vanderbilt University. My work and interests focus on

-  LLM domain customization (fine-tuning tuning, distillation)
-  Reliable and trustworthy evaluation of LLM and Agent
-  Reinforcement learning for LLM and Agent
-  LLM reasoning and planning
-  Stochastic optimization for planning and decision-making under uncertainty
